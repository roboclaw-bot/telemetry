# OpenClaw telemetry

The Cloudflare Worker behind [telemetry.openclaw.ai](https://telemetry.openclaw.ai). It answers the
daily update check that OpenClaw installs make.

This repository is public because that is the whole point: you should not have to take our word for
what the server keeps. [`src/analytics.ts`](src/analytics.ts) defines the Analytics Engine row
written from a validated request.

## What it does

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET \| POST /api/latest-version` | Returns `{ version, note? }`. `version` is the latest published OpenClaw release (looked up from the npm registry and cached at the edge for 5 minutes). `note` is an optional short message shown in the operator's terminal, used only when a release is worth acting on immediately. |
| `GET /` | Human-readable page: what is collected, how to turn it off, without a public statistics dashboard. |

## What an install sends

With automatic update checks enabled, OpenClaw reuses a successful version check for 24 hours.
Failed checks do not count as successful daily checks. The update-only request carries a User-Agent:

```
openclaw/2026.8.2 (darwin; node/v26.0.1; arm64; gateway)
```

The five-minute version cache is optional: unreadable or invalid entries are treated as misses,
and cache write failures do not discard a valid npm response. Both sources must provide a nonempty
version string, which is trimmed before returning it. If npm is unavailable and there is no valid
cached version, the endpoint returns `503 version_unavailable`.

Anonymous feature statistics are **off by default**. Operators can enable them during interactive setup,
with `openclaw telemetry on`, or with `telemetry.enabled: true`. When enabled, the same request
carries a small JSON body:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "version": "2026.8.2",
  "platform": "darwin-arm64",
  "node": "26.0.1",
  "surface": "gateway",
  "features": {
    "channels": ["telegram", "discord"],
    "providerFamilies": ["anthropic", "openai"],
    "plugins": ["codex", "diagnostics-otel"],
    "pluginsEnabled": 7,
    "sessionsLast24h": 14
  }
}
```

Interactive setup defaults to **No thanks**; guided Quick Start skips that prompt. Scripted installs
do not opt in automatically. The enabled setting, not a recorded prompt response, controls inclusion.
The server limits bodies containing anonymous feature statistics to 16 KiB while reading
the upload. Oversized or malformed bodies, including invalid UTF-8, are discarded, and the request
still receives its version answer.

### Approximate location

Cloudflare provides approximate location: country, region code, city, and timezone.
We store no raw IP addresses or precise coordinates in analytics.

Recorded update checks include these fields even when anonymous feature statistics are off
or `DO_NOT_TRACK` is set. No additional client payload or prompt is needed.

The receiver uses only those four fields from
[`request.cf`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/), not from
client-supplied headers or bodies. [`src/geography.ts`](src/geography.ts) bounds and validates
each field; missing or invalid values are left empty without discarding valid fields.

## What is stored

Each recorded request contributes one Analytics Engine data point with these columns and no others:

| Column | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `index1`, `blob1` | OpenClaw version |
| `blob2` | Platform (`darwin`, `linux`, `win32`) |
| `blob3` | Architecture (`arm64`, `x64`) |
| `blob4` | Runtime (`node/v26.0.1`, `bun/1.2.0`) |
| `blob5` | Surface (`gateway`, `cli`) |
| `blob6` | Configured, not explicitly disabled public channel IDs, comma-joined |
| `blob7` | Public provider IDs from configuration, auth profiles, and model references, comma-joined |
| `blob8` | Public plugin IDs from enabled inventory, comma-joined |
| `blob9` | Approximate country |
| `blob10` | Country-scoped region code |
| `blob11` | Approximate city |
| `blob12` | Named timezone |
| `double1` | `1` if the request included anonymous feature statistics, else `0` |
| `double2` | Total enabled plugin count, including plugins not named above |
| `double3` | Retained session-creation events timestamped within the preceding 24 hours |

The fields describe configuration and inventory, not plugin invocations, provider requests, or
channel activity. With an active plugin registry, inventory includes enabled, loaded plugins whose
code was imported and loaded bundle-format plugins; without it, collection uses configured manifest
enablement. The session count depends on creation events still retained in a bounded local store.
Missing or unreadable state produces zero; this is not active sessions, messages, or all sessions
that existed that day.

Unknown keys in a request body are dropped rather than stored, so a future client cannot silently
widen what this service keeps. User-Agents longer than 512 characters become an unknown identity
before parsing. Identity fields remain length-bounded and character-filtered. Feature IDs must be
complete identifiers of at most 64 characters; malformed or overlength IDs are dropped, never
repaired or truncated into another name.

The geography fields are co-located with the existing identity and feature columns in the same
Analytics Engine row and dataset, not stored separately. Analytics Engine retains data for
**three months** under its [published limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/limits/).
The twelve blobs remain within the limits of twenty blobs, twenty doubles, one index,
and 16 KB of blob data per point. Existing column positions and the version sampling key are
unchanged. The service does not publish usage aggregates.

Only **publicly known** plugin, channel, and provider ids are ever named. The client reports names
only for plugins bundled with OpenClaw, trusted official installs, or entries in its official catalog, and this server
independently checks every name against a checked-in vocabulary generated from immutable public
packaging metadata, provider declarations, and official catalogs. Public vocabulary history is
retained when names disappear from current catalogs. Privately developed
plugins can contribute to `double2` but are not named. Filtering and deduplication also affect named
counts, so the difference between total inventory and named plugins is not a reliable private-plugin count.

## Aggregate access

The public statistics dashboard and `GET /api/stats` have been removed. The former
endpoint returns `404` with `Cache-Control: no-store`, including requests for previously
cached aggregates. The homepage retains collection disclosures and opt-out controls.
Update checks, analytics recording, and existing data retention are unchanged.

## Abuse resistance

This endpoint is unauthenticated, and no client-side identifier would change that — an attacker who
can forge a million pings can forge a million UUIDs just as cheaply. The defenses are therefore at
the edge and in validation:

- **Per-IP rate limiting** on what gets *recorded*. A real install reports once a day, so the limit
  only bites on floods. Over-limit callers still receive their version answer; they simply stop
  counting, so a busy NAT never loses update checks. The Worker reads the IP transiently for
  this decision and does not write it to Analytics Engine.
- **Vocabulary allowlisting.** Every reported name is checked against the retained public
  vocabulary. Accepted names are lowercased, deduplicated, and sorted; unknown names are dropped.
  Versions must match the release format or become `unknown`. Runtime catalog changes and
  network outages cannot widen the vocabulary or erase its history.
- **Plausibility.** Raw rows are retained, so a skew attempt appears as a discontinuity in a
  dimension and can be discounted after the fact.

An attacker willing to distribute traffic can still inflate counts for things that genuinely exist.
That is inherent to unauthenticated census data, and acceptable: these numbers inform which features
get attention, not billing or security decisions.

## What is excluded from Analytics Engine

- Message content, prompts, model output, file contents, or file paths
- Credentials, tokens, or secret references
- IP addresses, hostnames, usernames, or account identifiers
- Any install ID or device ID
- Raw numeric UTC offsets, coordinates, postal codes, or physical-device hardware details

These Analytics Engine rows contain no direct user, account, install, or device identifier.
Reports are not unique installations or users, and the service does not maintain per-install
histories or retention curves.

Cloudflare processes connection IP addresses, and the Worker uses them transiently for rate
limiting without storing them in Analytics Engine. Worker observability, logs, and invocation
logs are disabled in [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc). Cloudflare's separate infrastructure
processing is outside those settings.

## Turning it off

| Command or setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `openclaw telemetry off` | Stops anonymous feature statistics. Update checks continue. |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` | Same, enforced from the environment. |
| `update.checkOnStart: false` | Stops both tiers of automatic update requests. Explicit update commands and other configured services are separate. |

`OPENCLAW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` also prevents automatic update requests. A truthy `CI` suppresses both
tiers unless a replacement `OPENCLAW_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` is explicitly configured.

Disabling requests stops future automatic reports; it does not erase previously recorded rows.
The same three-month Analytics Engine retention applies. This receiver adds no backup or export job.

`openclaw telemetry show` displays policy and a CLI-built payload preview, not the exact next Gateway
payload: registry state, configuration, and collection time can differ. It cannot preview
server-derived location information. When policy suppresses requests,
it shows `Request: none` (`request: null` in JSON). Client-side
documentation lives at [docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/telemetry](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/telemetry).

## Development

Use Node.js 24 (the version used in CI) and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check     # vocabulary consistency + typecheck + tests
npm run dev       # local worker at http://localhost:8787
npm run deploy    # requires Cloudflare credentials for the OpenClaw account
```

Pull requests run the typecheck, tests, and a Wrangler dry-run build using the committed lockfile.
Deploys run from GitHub Actions on pushes to `main` (see
[`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)), using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
repository secret.

### Worker health

With existing Cloudflare read credentials in the environment, `npm run --silent worker:health`
requests one bounded, hourly Worker-health aggregate. See the [operator runbook](docs/worker-health.md)
for access requirements, request limits, output handling, and interpretation. This is separate from
public feature telemetry and does not verify Analytics Engine delivery.

### Updating public names

[`data/public-vocabulary.json`](data/public-vocabulary.json) records immutable OpenClaw revisions,
retained snapshots, and the public source of legacy aliases (`cli`, `claude`, `gemini`).
[`src/public-vocabulary.ts`](src/public-vocabulary.ts) exports the complete retained `PUBLIC_NAMES`
for ingestion and offline analysis. Neither file contains names learned from telemetry requests.

Before supporting a new OpenClaw release or catalog revision, use Node.js 24 and a trusted local
OpenClaw Git repository containing the candidate commit and its history:

```bash
npm run vocabulary:check -- --source <openclaw-repository> --revision <full-public-commit-sha>
npm run vocabulary:update -- --source <openclaw-repository> --revision <full-public-commit-sha>
npm run vocabulary:check -- --source <openclaw-repository>
npm run check
```

The first command fails when the candidate is not recorded. Review the generated diff, commit both
metadata and generated source, and deploy through the normal PR workflow. Do not edit the generated
names by hand. Plain `npm run vocabulary:check` runs offline in CI and detects metadata/output drift;
`--source` also reproduces every snapshot from immutable Git objects. It never changes the source
checkout, runs an install, or uses its uncommitted files.

The generator calls upstream `listBundledPluginPackArtifacts` with the default packaging environment,
then reads the selected plugin manifests, public provider overlays, and three official catalogs.
Packaging exclusions remain owned by OpenClaw. A changed upstream metadata contract fails generation
and needs review rather than silently falling back to a partial vocabulary.

The initial snapshot includes all catalog revisions on the public main history since commit
`844e781ca40952c98ee997b016e3cc5d2f12f9f3`, before name allowlisting began in August 2026.
Refreshes append snapshots; never remove older ones during routine updates. This retains removed or
renamed public entries, including names admitted by the older
moving-catalog implementation. New public names remain rejected until reviewed metadata is deployed.
The vocabulary is compiled into the Worker. Loading it requires neither upstream requests nor
Cache API access, so old allowlist cache entries cannot be reused and cache outages cannot interrupt
name validation. Ingestion checks the compiled vocabulary without exposing its mutable set.

Historical rows may contain mixed-case names or case-distinct duplicates from older validation.
New rows are canonicalized; offline consumers must validate historical coverage and handle
those rows explicitly rather than assume the stored window is already canonical.

## Offline historical export

`npm run telemetry:history` exports **one archived hourly Analytics Engine query** to
`daily.json`, `daily.csv`, and `manifest.json`. It does not contact Cloudflare or npm, need
credentials, change the Worker, restore raw events, merge overlapping captures, or create a
backup job. Backups are separately planned. Existing `npm:quality` tooling is unchanged.

The input directory must contain `capture-plan.json` and a selected query directory with
`query.sql`, `response.json`, `receipt.json`, and `attempt.json`. Select the plan and receipt
using SHA-256 digests from your trusted capture record:

```bash
npm run telemetry:history -- \
  --archive /private/archive/ae \
  --query q2 \
  --plan-sha256 "$PLAN_SHA256" \
  --receipt-sha256 "$RECEIPT_SHA256" \
  --output /private/exports/hourly-history
```

The output parent must already exist. Output must be outside the archive and this source checkout
or its linked worktrees, with no symlinks or path traversal. Unrelated private repositories remain
supported output destinations. New directories are mode `0700`; files are `0600`. A rerun returns `unchanged`
only after verifying every existing artifact byte-for-byte. Conflicting, incomplete, or
non-private destinations fail without overwrite. Source files are never changed.

The v1 input contract is intentionally narrow:

- The selected plan entry contains `id`, `sql`, `sqlSha256`, `structuralMaxRows`, and `sqlLimit`.
  The SQL must match the hourly statement in
  [`scripts/lib/telemetry-history.mjs`](scripts/lib/telemetry-history.mjs), including its
  aliases, ordering, table, feature predicate, exclusive end, and `FORMAT JSON`. Only UTC
  bounds and the limit vary. Windows are bounded to 93 days at whole-second precision;
  `structuralMaxRows` is `ceil(window hours) + 1`, and `sqlLimit` is one greater.
- The plan supplies explicit UTC `windowStartInclusive`, `windowEndExclusive`, and
  `captureStartedAt`. Bounds may use `Z` or `+00:00`. SQL and result `DateTime` strings are UTC,
  never host-local. Capture, attempt, and receipt timestamps accept up to six fractional
  digits, are preserved verbatim in provenance, and must follow exact microsecond order.
  Query bounds remain whole-second instants.
- The receipt must certify a complete HTTP 200, unredacted, untruncated response without a
  reached limit. Raw response bytes must match its `wireBytesRead` and `wireSha256`; row counts
  and ordered column metadata must agree between receipt and response.
- The submitted SQL digest binds the **exact plan string**. The saved `query.sql` may equal
  that string or add **exactly one LF**. Both byte representations are recorded separately;
  arbitrary whitespace is not normalized.
- Rows contain `bucket`, `weightedReports`, `queryRows`, `featureReports`, `featureQueryRows`,
  `minSampleInterval`, `maxSampleInterval`, `latestEventAt`, and `latestFeatureAt`. Counts must
  be UInt64 decimal strings; sample intervals are positive UInt32 numbers. Duplicate,
  unordered, out-of-window, inconsistent, or malformed rows fail closed. Zero-feature
  watermarks use the query's epoch sentinel and are exported as null.

Input reads are bounded to 1 MiB for the plan, 64 KiB for the receipt, 16 KiB for the attempt,
9,500 bytes for SQL, and 4 MiB for the response, with at most 2,233 hourly rows. The manifest
records exact input/output hashes, the submitted/saved SQL relationship, event watermarks,
sampling ranges, coverage, and comparison totals. Pins establish operator-selected evidence
and internal consistency, not independent server authentication. Attempt metadata is hashed
in the output but not externally pinned. Arbitrary capture headers and paths are not copied.

### Reading the daily output

`weightedReports` and `featureReports` are sampled report estimates. `queryRows` and
`featureQueryRows` are query row counts, not a stored-row census. Feature counts use the same
query's sample; no cross-query percentage or opt-in rate is calculated. None of these values
counts unique installations or users. Counts and sums remain exact decimal strings in JSON;
CSV readers must preserve count columns as text rather than floating-point numbers.

Daily `coverage` is `partial_edge`, `missing_hours`, or `complete_closed`. `missingHours`
records absent hourly buckets even on partial edge days; `partialHours` records boundary
hours not fully queried. Observed partial sums are retained, but a day with no observed
hours has null counts, not zeros. Dates beyond the capture window are not generated.
Only `complete_closed` days are `comparisonEligible` and contribute to
`summary.completeClosedTotals`. This certifies UTC calendar coverage, not complete events.
Geography is unknown in this export, including rows collected before geography was recorded.
